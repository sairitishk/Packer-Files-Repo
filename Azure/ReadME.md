- There are some issues with azure templates. 

- While installing docker, in usermod command, its showing ubuntu user does not exist. Happened only in azure.


- For creds: create app registration in entra ID. And in subscription, give the app reg. contributor role.
With this can pass the 4 params in template and use. (use az cli auth not working)
